This lab I had a couple of issues with, as i kind of tried to breeze through this one, but the PDF kind of made that hard. While I caught some typos, like a random v in the middle of the code block, some I did not catch, leading to some hair-pulling moments. The first example that comes to mind is when we implement the attack. The update of the keys to add space was not highlighted, and while it was 100% my fault for not noticing even without the highlight, it still lead to some debugging that was frustrating until I realized what had happened. There was also another with the power up collision, where it took me a little bit to realize the implemented code in the PDF was not correct, as the collect_powerup and  this.collectPowerUp did not match, so it would not work. Other than these few hiccups, I feel like this lab was a good way to teach and use JavaScript OOP.
