Bootstrap is a very useful and cool tool to use. But, I can see how it can be limiting, and why you would want to make your own CSS. Besides that however, it is useful when you don't feel like making something from scratch, or are on a very little time budget to make something work. Other than something along those lines though, I would feel like it is better to make it from scratch instead of using bootstrap.
